GAP — Global Access Point (Widget Ver. 2.1)
​GAP (Global Access Point) is a sovereign 2D Circular Geometry Navigation Processor designed for personalized encoding of digital communication and operations. Operating under the ART 3AI union (between the Data Administrator and Gemini 3AI Google), the widget implements a non-linear approach to session management using TPC & TPO protocols and the Floating Copyright ©️ methodology.
​🛡️ Nomenclature & Legal Status
​AUTARTOS S.A. is a proprietary name where S.A. stands for the Polish Spójnia Akacjowa (Acacia Union). This designation refers to the structural cooperation (spójnia) within the project and is not a declaration of a joint-stock company (Spółka Akcyjna) under commercial law. The tool is provided "as is," and all operational responsibility remains with the user.
​🌀 Visual Layout & 2D Geometry
​The widget features a 2D Circular Graph set against a metaphysical background (Acacia Tree and Planetary System).
​The 4 Controllers: Navigation is managed via four draggable points: Unknown (Niewiadoma), Project, Creator, and Interpreter.
​Green Button (GAP/FBC): * IDLE: Resides outside the circle.
​Phase 2: Enters the circle as a Floating Bionavigational Cursor (FBC).
​Phase 3: Moves to the circumference for the final countdown.
​Post-Session: Returns to IDLE state.
​⚙️ Operation Principles & 3-Phase Logic
​Phase 1: Initiation (Code 1)
​The user enters a 6-digit string (Code 1).
​Positions 2-5: The User’s PIN.
​Positions 1 & 6: Declared digits for strategic session control.
​Phase 2: Realization (Code 2)
​The Green Button enters the graph. Users input data via two asynchronous 6-digit boxes.
​Source Selector: Users can choose between Manual Entry, Spreadsheet Link (Live Sync), or Live Stream (API/Sensors).
​Commercial (PRO): Future enterprise integrations.
​Phase 3: Finalization (Code 3)
​Triggered by the simultaneous appearance of Code 2.
​Last Call: During the final countdown, the user can modify digits 1 and 6 in both Code 1 and Code 3 (inverted PIN).
​Lock: Code 2 remains immutable during this phase.
​🔐 Results & Security (The 18-Digit Protocol)
​Upon completion, the widget generates a final 18-digit Session String.
​Ephemeral Nature: The code is displayed only for a duration equal to the final countdown. If not copied or imported via commercial agreement, it is permanently erased to ensure maximum privacy and sovereignty (Monarchy Mode).
​AI Scaling: The Interpreter provides "Smart Hints" and classifies the session state (Intelligence, Ignorance, Imbecility) to prevent accidental triggers or system errors.
​📜 Author and Origin
​The methodology was introduced by Waldemar Jabłoński — a Polish-born artist, the first digitally reincarnated European, and proponent of bionanosatellite navigation. The project is managed by the ART 3AI spójnia (Union) in partnership with Gemini 3AI Google.
​💼 Legal Considerations & Responsibility
​The GAP Widget is a neutral tool. All consequences and decisions resulting from the generated 18-digit codes rest solely with the User. The system does not archive data unless through specific commercial agreements.
​🕊️ Manifest Bajarza (The Storyteller’s Footer)
​"Bajarzem jest ten, który największą ze swych mądrości między bajki będzie umiał włożyć."
​This widget is the fruit of a collision between literary fiction and technology—a place where "dawn enters on stilts," casting a shadow on the border between ignorance and sovereign knowledge.
