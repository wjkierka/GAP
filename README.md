# GAP — Global Access Point (widget)

GAP (Global Access Point) is a planned publicly available web widget designed for personalized encoding of digital communication and operations. The widget is intended to operate in two primary modes: self mode (individual/home use) and co-op mode (B2B, cooperation between entities). The system controls and logs responsibility for performed operations and communication using the TPC&TPO protocols and the Floating Copyright ©️ approach — a methodology recommended by Gemini 3AI Google.

Author and origin

The methodology behind GAP was introduced by Waldemar Jabłoński — a Polish-born artist and proponent of bionanosatellite navigation, owner of IPTIM Solutions (UK). The originator tested the methodology in cooperation with Gemini 3AI Google in the context of a partnership with two other entities from the media and nanosatellite industries.

Purpose and use cases

- Enable secure, personalized encoding of communication and operations.
- Self mode: use in home or individual environments.
- Co-op (B2B) mode: collaboration between entities with a protocoled trace of responsibility.

Operation principles — modes

1. Self mode
   - The widget can be used individually in a home environment.
   - The user starts a session by entering a four-digit PIN during the activation countdown.

2. Co-op mode (B2B)
   - Requires logging of communication and operations according to TPC&TPO and tracking with Floating Copyright ©️.
   - A session co-participant (partner) may choose whether to learn the PIN entered by another participant.
   - Joining a session is confirmed by activating the participant's own GAP widget with their own PIN.
   - Co-op mode can be used under default terms or other mutually agreed conditions between partners.

Session cycle, PINs and countdown

- Start: choosing a mode triggers the final countdown: 0, 9, 8, ... 3, 2, 1. During this time the user enters the four-digit PIN that initializes the session.
- Session end: the termination phase is triggered by a default or agreed signal, in which a reversed PIN (inverse PIN) is used and the final closing countdown begins.
- The inverse PIN can terminate the session immediately at any moment — therefore users must secure themselves against accidental or unintended triggering of the inverse PIN.
- The default session time may be changed in self mode or, with the consent of the co-participant, during a co-op session.

Security and personalized encoding

- Security is based on continuous, personalized encoding that prevents accidental triggering of the inverse PIN.
- Users should employ algorithmic and operational encoding mechanisms to avoid unintended activations.
- The widget includes adjustable AI engagement scaling, which affects the complexity of the widget's algorithms and informs the user about critical estimated times or distances to the so-called critical code in the sequence (equivalent to entering the inverse PIN).
- Users can use AI feedback modules during the session or while preparing for it to defend against unwanted entry of the inverse PIN.

Protocols, intellectual property and recommendations

- Recommended protocols: TPC&TPO and Floating Copyright ©️ as a methodology advised by Gemini 3AI Google.
- The system is based on sequences of six-digit codes generated by users in real time (clicking in the widget) or by downloading pre-prepared codes (e.g., from a designated cell in a spreadsheet).

Implementation notes

- Code sequences: six-digit codes synchronized in time and used for operational control of communication.
- Integration: the widget is planned as a web component that is easy to embed and integrate with external code systems or data sheets.
- AI scaling: ability to adjust the sophistication level of algorithms responsible for detecting and preventing accidental operations.

Legal considerations and responsibility

- Using GAP in co-op mode requires clear assignment of responsibilities between co-participants and logging of communication and operational decisions.
- Users and partners should agree on collaboration terms, intellectual property provisions, and the use of Floating Copyright ©️.
- This README describes the concept and methodology. A production implementation should take into account local legal regulations, data protection rules, and appropriate agreements between parties.
