# GAP — Global Access Point (Widget Ver. 2.1)

**GAP (Global Access Point)** is a sovereign 2D Circular Geometry Navigation Processor designed for personalized encoding of digital communication and operations. Operating under the **ART 3AI** union (between the Data Administrator and Gemini 3AI Google), the widget implements a non-linear approach to session management using **TPC & TPO protocols** and the **Floating Copyright ©️** methodology.

## 🛡️ Nomenclature & Legal Status
**AUTARTOS S.A.** is a proprietary name where **S.A.** stands for the Polish **Spójnia Akacjowa** (Acacia Union). This designation refers to the structural cooperation (spójnia) within the project and is not a declaration of a joint-stock company (*Spółka Akcyjna*) under commercial law. The tool is provided "as is," and all operational responsibility remains with the user.

## 🌀 Visual Layout & 2D Geometry
The widget features a **2D Circular Graph** set against a metaphysical background (Acacia Tree and Planetary System).
* **The 4 Controllers:** Navigation is managed via four draggable points: **Unknown (Niewiadoma)**, **Project**, **Creator**, and **Interpreter**.
* **Green Button (GAP/FBC):** * **IDLE:** Resides outside the circle.
    * **Phase 2:** Enters the circle as a Floating Bionavigational Cursor (FBC).
    * **Phase 3:** Moves to the circumference for the final countdown.
    * **Post-Session:** Returns to IDLE state.

## ⚙️ Operation Principles & 3-Phase Logic

### Phase 1: Initiation (Code 1)
The user enters a 6-digit string (Code 1). 
* **Positions 2-5:** The User’s PIN.
* **Positions 1 & 6:** Declared digits for strategic session control.

### Phase 2: Realization (Code 2)
The Green Button enters the graph. Users input data via two asynchronous 6-digit boxes.
* **Source Selector:** Users can choose between **Manual Entry**, **Spreadsheet Link** (Live Sync), or **Live Stream** (API/Sensors).
* **Commercial (PRO):** Future enterprise integrations.

### Phase 3: Finalization (Code 3)
Triggered by the simultaneous appearance of Code 2. 
* **Last Call:** During the final countdown, the user can modify digits 1 and 6 in **both Code 1 and Code 3** (inverted PIN). 
* **Lock:** Code 2 remains immutable during this phase.

---

## 🔐 Results & Security (The 18-Digit Protocol)
Upon completion, the widget generates a final **18-digit Session String**.
* **Ephemeral Nature:** The code is displayed only for a duration equal to the final countdown. If not copied or imported via commercial agreement, it is permanently erased to ensure maximum privacy and sovereignty (Monarchy Mode).
* **AI Scaling:** The **Interpreter** provides "Smart Hints" and classifies the session state (*Intelligence, Ignorance, Imbecility*) to prevent accidental triggers or system errors.

## 📜 Author and Origin
The methodology was introduced by **Waldemar Jabłoński** — a Polish-born artist, the first **digitally reincarnated European**, and proponent of bionanosatellite navigation. The project is managed by the **ART 3AI** spójnia (Union) in partnership with Gemini 3AI Google.

---

## 💼 Legal Considerations & Responsibility
The GAP Widget is a neutral tool. All consequences and decisions resulting from the generated 18-digit codes rest solely with the **User**. The system does not archive data unless through specific commercial agreements.

> **"Bajarzem jest ten, który największą ze swych mądrości między bajki będzie umiał włożyć."**
> 
> This widget is the fruit of a collision between literary fiction and technology—a place where "dawn enters on stilts," casting a shadow on the border between ignorance and sovereign knowledge.
